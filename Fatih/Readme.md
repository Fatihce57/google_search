## Project

This week, I would like you to create a sample project imitating Google's view. All you have to do see, open your browser and go to `google.com`. Then just open up your preferred IDE and start coding! You are free to choose your programming language to create the project. Before you start, make sure to read below.

There is bunch of people working in this repository. In order to make it easier for us, every time you start with the project you have to follow this steps:

## Setup

First clone this repo in your local machine by typing

`git clone git@github.com:SideProjectsChannel/Homeworks.git`

then switch to the folder

`cd Homework`

then you have to create a new branch that starts with your name and also consists of what the project is. An example would be:

`joe/google-replica`

Once you have created a branch, you are free to start with your work.

Whenever you have a question, you can create a pull request and somebody will try to answer your question!

Once you are done with the project, make sure to create a pull request so that somebody can review your code.

Happy coding!
